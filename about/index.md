  I'm Ernie E. Fontes. I'm a postdoc in mathematics who did his PhD at the
  University of Texas and his undergraduate studies at Harvard. My
  [math research](../math/) is in homotopy theory and category theory.
  I'm currently leaving academia and retooling for a career in data science.

  I am also a passionate baker, making fresh loaves of naturally-leavened bread
  most weekends. I am a skilled pizzaiolo, with a focus on thin-crust neo-Neapolitan
  pizza which I cook in my Roccbox. I'm a dedicated rock climber (bouldering > lead)
  and I maintain a regular yoga practice. I also am an amateur photography enthusiast
  and I listen to many hours of indie music on Spotify.
