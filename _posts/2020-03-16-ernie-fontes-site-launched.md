title: "Ernie Fontes Launches Improved Website"

Well. I've finally upgraded from a static, single-page [math-department website](https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/fontes.17/) to a more professional personal website. It seemed to be a no-brainer to use GitLab's sites since my needs are pretty low.

My goals with this site:
* Provide my **resume** information for my upcoming non-academic job search.
* Keep my legacy of academic **math** contributions available, as those ongoing projects wind down.
* Provide updates through this **blog** as I work on various data science projects to market my developing skills.
* Give room for me to share some of my favorite **hobbies**, like: naturally-leavened bread, photography, and thin-crust pizza.
